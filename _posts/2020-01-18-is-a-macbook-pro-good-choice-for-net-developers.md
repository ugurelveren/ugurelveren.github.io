Mac family has too many cool features, especially macbook pro. It is a good  laptop for developers. Up to 10 hours battary life, touch bar and retina display are amazing features.  Also if you are a linux user, macOs terminals are similar to linux because of macOs is based on Unix. On the other hand if you are an IOS developer, you don't have any choice other than macbook. You need to install XCode or any other IDE and you need to plug your phone on your macbook.

Other than swift programing language, you can easily develop too many languages on macOs like Ruby or Python or Nodejs. After a few installation steps you can start to develop.

With .net core you can develop c# too. .Net core is open source, cross platform development platform. But the story was different for the c# before .net core. It was a dream to develop c# on macOs. Only exception was the Mono Project. With the Mono project, people started to run c# project on linux machine. It was not a perfect solution but the idea was wonderful. You can build and run your c# code on Linux operating systems. C# community liked that idea. Too many developer tried mono project with linux operating system. Also you can find unexpected stories on Mono Project like developers run applications with C# on Nokia 770.

After 14 years from first beta version for .net framework , microsoft [annouced](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-open-source/) that .net core project was a open source project and it would support multiple platform like Linux Or MacOs. With this announcement evolution started. Microsoft created huge open source community and developed too many useful tools for other operating system with this huge community like visual studio code.

On the other hand, I am a huge fan of Microsoft. I have been developing c# for 9 years and I love Microsoft products. But i bought MacBook a few weeks ago. Before the MacBook Pro I have been using Microsoft Surface Book for 2 years on my company and my personal computer was Asus. But my personel computer was burned two weeks ago and i decided to buy a new one. So first i decided to buy a Surface but something happened and i bought a new macbook pro. 

And this is a story behind my blog post. I tried .net core with Visual Studio for Mac and i wanted to share my expericence with you. 

If you are using Visual Studio code it is very easy to get used to it. There is no difference between mac and windows because Visual studio Code is very clean, lightweight IDE and it is working well with macOs. Just develop something with .net core and type dotnet run on terminal. You won't feel any difference between Mac and Windows. It will work well. But if you try to develop sometingh with Visual Studio for mac, you will start to feel difference. Also you can use VS Code with other langunages. It has a huge plugin support.

I can not say same thing for the Visual Studio for Mac. First of all Visual Studio is one of the best IDE so far. Actually I think, it is the best product that Microsoft produce. The problem is Visual Studio for Mac. It is not Visual Studio. It is Xamarin Studio. Only name is similar with Visual Studio.  Shortcuts are awful. Some of them are gone or some of them are using different key combinations. Search is different. Layout is different. Really different. For example solution box starts on right side of the IDE. It is different IDE for different operating system. You need to work on settings, if you want to create similar IDE for Visual Studio. This is only problem for .net core on macOS. Other than that, you can easly develop .net core on macBook. 

Also if you want to develop quick and dirty desktop application with Forms. It is really hard because there is no designer.  But you can easly develop console application in a minute. 

After all of these my conclusion is , if you are hard core c# developer and you get used to Visual Studio, don't try to do it with macbook. But if you are already developing other language and you want to develop .net core, don't problem go for it. Mac environment is very good for developing .net core.
