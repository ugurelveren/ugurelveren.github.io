Here we go. First shot.

After I decided to create my personal blog, I started to think about what should I use and what do I need? 

First thing on my mind that it should be simple. It doesn't need to be one of the fancy Cms solutions. I don't need too many plugins for running the blog. I just want to share my post. 
And then I realized that I don't need a database or all the other stuff. I just want to share text and photos. 

I started my Jekyll adventure with this idea. It shouldn't be fancy.

What is Jekyll. 

Jekyll is a static content or site generator. It developed in Ruby and it has a huge open source community. You can create a static website or content with Jekyll.

Yes said static twice. First, we can look at Dynamic web pages. Dynamic web sites generate web page after the user create a request. These are pulling page content from one of the data storage like database, JSON files, or caches and then they are building Html with this data. 

Static web pages are simple than a dynamic rival. The web site has a series of the Html page and for each request, web site returns one of the Html pages to the user.

Jekyll is a little bit different. We can say, Jekyll stands between dynamic and static web pages.

Technically, Jekyll is not a static web site. It is a parsing engine. It is building static websites from dynamic components like templates.
First Jekyll parses your markdown content and it will generate some results like Html files. 

What are the benefits of Jekyll.

First of all, GitHub is supporting the Jekyll pages. Which means you can host Jekyll pages with GitHub. I don't know the exact number but maybe half of the GitHub pages are using Jekyll. You don't need to worry about your database or server performance. It will be fast because it is static content and it is free.

Also, Jekyll has a huge community. Too many people contribute to that project all around the world. On GitHub, it has 38k star which means it is the most popular static content generator. It has too many theme options open source and paid. Jekyll themes are using  Shopifyâ€™s Liquid template engine. There are too many developers already know that syntax and because of that options always increasing


The last thing, it is secure. We are talking about that static website. You can always find a security problem but on the Jekyll, it is very low. A lot of times, you just need to worry about your GitHub password.
