Here we go. First shot.

After i decided to create my personal blog , i started to think about that what should i use and what do i need? 

First thing  on my mind that it should be simple. It doesn't need to be one of the fancy Cms solutions. I don't need too many plugins for running the blog. I just want to share my post. 
And then i realized that i don't need database or all the other stuff. I just want to share text and photo. 

I started my Jekyll adventure with this idea. It shouldn't be fancy.

What is Jekyll. 

Jekyll is static content or site generator. It developed in Ruby and it has huge open source community. You can create static website or contents with Jekyll.

Yes said static twice. First we can look at Dynamic web pages. Dynamic web sites generate web page after user create a request. These are pulling page content  from one of the data storage like database, json files or caches and then they are building html with this data. 

Static web pages are simple than dynamic rival. The web site has series of html page and  for each request, web site return one of the html page to user.

Jekyll is a little bit different. We can say, Jekyll stands between dynamic and static web pages.

Technically, Jekyll is not static web site. It is a parsing engine. It is building static websites from dynamic components like templates.
First Jekyll parse a your markdown content and it will generate some results like html files. 

What is the benefits of Jekyll.

First of all, GitHub is supporting the Jekyll pages. Which means you can host Jekyll pages with GitHub. I don't know the exact number but maybe half of the GitHub pages are using Jekyll. You don't need to worry about your database or server performance. It will be fast because it is static content and it is free.

Also Jekyll has huge community. Too many people contribute that project all around the world. On GitHub, it has 38k star which means it is the most popular static content generator. It has too many theme options open source and paid. Jekyll themes are using  Shopifyâ€™s Liquid template engine. There are too many developers already know that syntax and because of that options always increasing


Last thing, it is secure. We are talking about that static website. You can always find security problem but on Jekyll side it is very low. A lot of times, you just need to worry about your GitHub password.
