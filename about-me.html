Hi. My name is Ugur, from Huntington Beach California.
</p>
I am working as Senior Cloud Architect on 11Health. I blog about technology, development tecniques, code, web etc... I am taking photos of people, nature . My biggest pleasure is discovering new places.
</p>
On my professional life, i am focusing on cloud tecnologies, especially aws and software development architecture. Therefore i want to write something about these. On the other hand I want to share my personel preferences, photos and new places. I hope it goes well and I can share all of these things at the same time.
